# **OLSA - Object Locator with Spatial Audio**

OLSA system integrates Simultaneous Localization and Mapping [[ORB SLAM-3]](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3/tree/master), advanced object detection [[Ultralytics-YOLOv8]](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and spatial audio technology [[OpenAL Soft]](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft), with the expectation of aiding visually impaired individuals. It detects objects using a monocular camera, maps them within a 3D space, and provides real-time spatial audio cues to help users understand the location and orientation of objects around them.
